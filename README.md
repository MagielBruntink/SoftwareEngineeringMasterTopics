Software Engineering Master Topics
====================================

Here we discuss the topics suitable for research-oriented students that have potential for scientific impact.
The assumed style is replication of a study that is described in a great paper that was recently published.

The intent here is not to replace the Thesis Fair website, which is still our front-end for students and organisations, and our tool to manage the Thesis Fair event.

Suggested usage:
 - Discuss topics in the Wiki, include links to papers.
 - Since we are a public repo, do not add PDFs unless sure that nobody will be mad.
